# Logistic-regression
Here we have tried to do logistic regression classification algorithm
# what is Regression?
Its a predictive modeling technique and it estimates the relationship between depaendent(target) and independent(predictor) variable.
# what and why Logistic Regression?
It produces result in binary format, which is used to predict outcome of an categorical dependend varibale. The output must be categorical/discrete values for example, 0 or 1, true or false, yes or no, low or high.
# Difference between linear and Logistic regression...
In linear the value we need to predict actually in a range but in Logistic its a discrete i.e,  for e.g,either 0 or 1.
# Implementing Logistic regression
## Collect Data
Our dataset is titanic having 12 atributes mixing for string values, categorical and quantitative also.
## Analysing Data
It ensures better understanding of the relationships among the attributes by visualized them with help of graph    
## Data Wrangling
It means cleaning the data for better performance of the model. It may be handling with null or missing values, dicretization of attribute values etc
 ## Train & Test
spliting train and test data, model selection, fitting training data to the model, Predict using test data
 ## Acuuracy check
different parameters measures can be use to check the accuracy for the model ie. evaluation parameters of a model can be diffrent like confussion matrix etc
## All these steps have been followed in this survival prediction task by taking titanic dataset 
## Thank You
